# Py4e

In order to learn Python I've been using Dr. Chuck's Python for Everybody course.

In this reposity I've stored some of the projects I've dabbled with as I was going through the course. 

Some are directly from the course, some are ideas that I had as I was going through the course and decided to try in order to help what I was learning stick.

Not all of them are complete, and many likely have errors.
